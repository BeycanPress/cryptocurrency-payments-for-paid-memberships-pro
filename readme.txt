== Description ==

### Cryptocurrency Payments for Paid Memberships Pro (PMPro)

First of all, we would like to point out that this plugin is not a standalone plugin. This plugin is a **<a href="https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&utm_medium=cryptopay_pmpro">cryptocurrency payment gateway</a>** for Paid Memberships Pro. In other words, users who want to sell memberships with cryptocurrency payment via WordPress can use Paid Memberships Pro. However, this plugin is a **<a href="https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&utm_medium=cryptopay_pmpro">cryptocurrency payment gateway</a>** for Paid Memberships Pro as well as an add-on for CryptoPay. So the payment is actually CryptoPay, which is the main plugin that manages the cryptocurrency payment process. Therefore, users must have both plugins.
